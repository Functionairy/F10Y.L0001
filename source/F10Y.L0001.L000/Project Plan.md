# F10Y.L0001.L000
Default library for the F10Y.L0001 Functionairy-opinioned but generally applicable .NET Standard 2.1 language-only (foundation) library.

Adds Functionairy opinionation to the F10Y.L0000 language-only library.

DOES NOT ALLOW NEW TYPES - No matter how fundamental or intrinsic!
For functionality that depends on new types see L004.

Allowed dependencies:

	- F10Y.L0000
	- Leaf within F10Y.L0001

That's it!

This library is really meant for functionality that is so fundamental it should be in the F10Y.L0000 language-only unopinionated library, but it has a Functionairy-opinionation.
